# ENGG1340 PROJECT
In this project, we will build a personal accounting system that can satisfy the following requirements:

1) add records of income and expenses;
2) the records should contain some basic information, like amount, date, types of income or expense (e.g. food, game,
salary, etc.), account (e.g cash, bank card, credit card, etc.);
3) the records could be deleted and edited at any time;
4) users could view their records by date, type, and account;
5) the system should provide statistical report of usersâ€™ financial state (e.g. monthly income and expenses, percentage of
food expenses, etc.);
6) the accounting system allows budget setting. When expenses reach the
budget, there should be an alert from the system
