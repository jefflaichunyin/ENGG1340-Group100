# ENGG1340 PROJECT ( SaveNow )

## Problem statement:
Overspending has become even easier because of technology advancement. People can buy things anytime and anywhere (online or in the real world). In extreme case, overspending can affect one's quality of life if they borrow loan. Although we could mark our income and outcome statement on the paper, it will be quite tedious process for us to extract useful information and grouping informations from it (e.g. figure out where do we spend most of our money)  and end up giving up easily. Also, people oftenly fail to meet their savings goal because they always find themselves an excuse to overspend (e.g. I will spend less next month but not this month because blah blah...). Therefore, in this project we are developing an easy way to record, manage and analyze our income/expense and we hope we could help our users to make informed decision before they buy and acheive their savings goal.
## Problem setting: 
*SaveNow* is a console personal accounting program designed for a family that consist of 3-5 members to use. Each family member will take turns to input the details of their every day transaction. They can set a savings goal for themselves and our program will calculate monthly saving goal and spending quota for them in order to help them to achieve their saving goals. The user can have an overview of their spending easily and adjust their spending habits in order to meet the monthly quota. Eventually, the users can avoid overspending and achieve their savings goal.
## Program features:
We have implemented the following program features:
1. add records of transaction (income/expense/transfer)
2. delete and edit records
3. users could view/search/sort their records by date, type, account...
4. provide a visualized statistical report for the users
5. allow users to set a savings goal, calculate monthly spending quota for the users and warn the user if they exceed the quota
6. create/remove user account, basic identity verification and allow users to change their password
7. use presence/range/type/length check to validate every user input
